Discovered at Sanguan Dianzi in Liaoning province, from the Neolithic  Hongshan Culture，this jade “Pig-Dragon” ornament is one of the first representations of the Dragon figure that we see in Chinese art culture. Neolithic cultures usually derived their art inspiration from nature itself, they still did not have a concrete sense of religion, nor the concept of longevity attached to the dragon. This type of artifact was found buried in stone ritual structures, giving them a ritualistic meaning (Ebrey). 
 Called a “Pig- Dragon” because of the similar form of the snout to that of a pig. This Dragon also has a long body characterized by a Chinese Dragon, yet it is in a  ring shape. To give this piece of jade this ring dragon shape neolithic villagers most had used sand and days to polish.

This small bronze applique in the form of a dragon is a small representation of the big detailed bronze artifacts common to the Shang Dynasty. Yet this 6.8 cm in length applique itself has many details. The first detail will be the similarity to the Neolithic Pig- Dragon, due to the similarity of the snout to that of a pig. The detailing also expressed the common characteristic in Chinese Dragon of a long body with scales, short arms, and horns. During the Shang dynasty the dragon figure was overshadowed by the mystical figure of the taotie (Kesner). So this figure is really special, as we can have a complete image of how the dragon was vision during this time. The Dragon usually was used as a small collide decoration symbol in many of the Shang bronze vessels, later it became a popular symbol for ceremonial ritual vessels (Kesner). Yet still it still was crafted in a smaller version than that of the taotie.
