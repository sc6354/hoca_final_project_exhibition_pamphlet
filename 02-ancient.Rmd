# Dragon Art in Ancient China {-#ancient}

Discovered at Sanguan Dianzi in Liaoning province, from the Neolithic  Hongshan Culture，this jade “Pig-Dragon” ornament is one of the first representations of the Dragon figure that we see in Chinese art culture. Neolithic cultures usually derived their art inspiration from nature itself, they still did not have a concrete sense of religion, nor the concept of longevity attached to the dragon. This type of artifact was found buried in stone ritual structures, giving them a ritualistic meaning (Ebrey). 
 Called a “Pig- Dragon” because of the similar form of the snout to that of a pig. This Dragon also has a long body characterized by a Chinese Dragon, yet it is in a  ring shape. To give this piece of jade this ring dragon shape neolithic villagers most had used sand and days to polish.
