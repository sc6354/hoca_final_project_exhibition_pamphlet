Some of the works in this collection have known artists, which allowed us to delved deeper into the artist’s technique or motivation. However, most works do not have known artists, but are still included because they are central to our narrative. Our goal was to curate a few dragon artwork(s) from the following time periods to offer a wholistic timeline of how the meaning and usage of dragon artworks changed and evolved through time: Ancient China Zhou and Han Dynasties Tang Dynasty Song and Yuan Dynasties Ming and Qing Dynasties Logistically, this online exhibition ran from Novemeber 20, 2020 to December 31, 2020 on the platform, artspaces.kunmatrix.com. This booklet is meant to serve as an exhibition pamplet for the accompany online exhibition. Lastly, everyone on the team would like to thank Professor Lala Zuo for her support and resource recommendations. Sincerely, The Dragon Team Erica Im, Coordinator Susan Chen, Pamplet and Exhibition Designer Megan Rhodes, Writer Devon Kampman, Wrtier Astrid Matute Blanco, Writer "],
