Some of the works in this collection have a known artist, which allowed us to delve deeper into the artist’s technique and motivations. However, most works do not have a known artist, but are still included because they are central to our narrative. Our goal was to curate a few dragon artworks from the following time periods to offer a wholistic narrative of how the meaning and usage of dragon artworks has changed and evolved throughout time: Ancient China Zhou and Han Dynasties Tang Dynasty Song and Yuan Dynasties Ming and Qing Dynasties Logistically, this online exhibition ran from Novemeber 20, 2020 to December 31, 2020 on the platform, artspaces.kunmatrix.com. This booklet is meant to serve as an exhibition pamplet for the accompanying online exhibition. Lastly, everyone on the team would like to thank Professor Lala Zuo for her support and resource recommendations. Sincerely, The Dragon Team Erica Im, Coordinator Susan Chen, Pamphlet and Exhibition Designer Megan Rhodes, Writer Devon Kampman, Wrtier Astrid Matute Blanco, Writer "],
["intro.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Unlike the Western dragon, which is often depicted as a monster for noble figures to slay, the Chinese dragon is depicted as having a sacred, precious relationship with the Chinese people. As a long-enduring auspicious symbol, the dragon’s appearance in artistic and political objects has established its position as a symbol for the Chinese nation. Perhaps nothing is as “Chinese,” artistically speaking, as the dragon. This brief exhibition will take viewers through the creation and development of the Chinese dragon, from its origins as ritual carvings in the Neolithic period to its complex appearance in the Qing dynasty.

["ancient.html", "Dragon Art in Ancient China", " Dragon Art in Ancient China (c. 3500 BC., Hongshan Culture, Neolithic period). Pig-Dragon Ring; Jade. The National Museum of China, Beijing, China. Discovered at Sanguan Dianzi in Liaoning province, from the Neolithic Hongshan Culture，this jade Pig-Dragon ornament (pictured above) is one of the first representations of the Dragon figure that we see in Chinese art history. Neolithic cultures usually derived their art inspiration from nature itself as these cultures did not have a concrete sense of religion, nor understand the concept of longevity that was later attached to the dragon. This type of artifact was found buried in stone ritual structures, indicating that it was mostly likely used in a ritualistic setting (Ebrey). It is called a Pig-Dragon because the form of the snout is very similiar to that of a pig. This dragon also exhibits a relatively long body that characterizes the Chinese dragon, and yet it is in a ring shape. In order to create this ring shape, neolithic villagers had to polish it with sand for days. (13th–11th century B.C., Shang Dynasty). Appliqué in the Form of a Dragon, Bronze. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, United States. This second sculpture, Bronze Applique in the Form of a Dragon, is a small representation of the big detailed bronze artifacts common to the Shang Dynasty. Despite its rather small size of 6.8 cm in length, the applique itself still has many details. The most noticeable detail is its similarity to the Neolithic Pig-Dragon, to which it shares the pig snout design. The detailing also expresses common characteristic of the Chinese dragon such as the long body with scales, short arms, and horns. During the Shang dynasty, dragon figures was overshadowed by the mystical figure of the taotie (Kesner). Thus, these two figures are even more special, as they are one of the few existing and complete images of how the dragon was envisioned during this time. In general, the dragon was usually used as a small collide decoration symbol in many of the Shang bronze vessels, and later became a popular symbol for ceremonial ritual vessels (Kesner). However, its significance as a ritual decoration did not render its size to be comparable to the taotie, since it was still crafted in small sizes. "],
["zhou-han.html", "From Luxury Designs to Auspicious Symbols", " From Luxury Designs to Auspicious Symbols (3rd century BC, Eastern Zhou Dynasty, Warring States period). Knotted Dragon Pendant, Jade (nephrite). The Metropolitan Museum, New York. The Knotted Dragon Pendant artifact is from the Eastern Zhou dynasty during the Warring States period (475-221BC). It is made of Jade, or nephrite and has a height of 7.9cm and width of 5.2cm. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York first exhibited this artifact in the 2005 “Arts of Ancient China” exhibition. It was donated by the Ernest Erickson Foundation in 1985. According to the museum, the exquisite detailing of the dragon head shape with the twisted rope body design shows the advanced technique of the Zhou Dynasty jade carvers. The Zhou Dynasty saw the emergence of a wealthy class with the rise of feudal states. By the Warring States period, they shifted away from the Confucius values on modesty, traditional rites, and devotion to society. As such, the wealthy elites used dragon form decorations to represent their individual wealth, high culture, and power. Therefore, the Zhou Dynasty started making works for the consumption and enjoyment of the wealthy class. Intricate animal form designs, like this dragon, emphasized the extravagant style and advanced technique used during this time. Unlike the Shang dynasty, the Zhou dynasty’s depiction of the dragon does not seem to emphasize a fear of nature and seemed to function as an ornamental display of luxury among the upper class. (206 BC – AD 9, Western Han Dynasty). Mirror with Nipple and Dragon Design, Bronze. The Metropolitan Museum, New York. The Mirror with Nipple and Dragon Design artifact is from the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 9). It is made of bronze with a diameter of approximately 15.6cm. The artifact was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and was purchased from Elizabeth V. Cockcroft in 2008. The Han Dynasty believed that the dragon had an auspicious meaning. Their beliefs were passed down from the Qin dynasty, where the First Emperor, ShiHuangdi, started the quest for immortality and claimed to have absorbed the immortal powers of the dragon to legitimize his claim to the throne as the Dragon King. The Han Dynasty believed it was a mystical, immortal creature that acted as a guardian to mortals as opposed to a beast to be feared like it was in the Shang Dynasty. Therefore, the Han bronze mirrors were decorated with the dragon design because people believed it would ward off evil and protect them on their journey if they carried it with them. The dragon design, along with three other mythical creatures, were used even on the later Han bronze TLV mirrors for the same purpose of protection for the men. "],
["tang.html", "Silk Road Influences", " Silk Road Influences (c. 8th century AD Tang Dynasty). Gilded dragon, Bronze with Iron Core.Shaanxi History Museum, Xi’an. This Gilded Dragon has toured the world several times, but is usually displayed in the Shaanxi Museum, which is closest to its area of discovery. This dragon seems to be a part from a larger luxury item collection belonging to the Tang period (8th Century AD). It is made from bronze with an iron core. This fiqure provides a clear example of the stylistic changes that the dragon underwent in this period: unlike previous dynasties, dragons in the Tang period start to take on a distinctive serpentine style, with longer tails and flowing forms that seem to be flying. This use of a dragon in a new artistic context is standard for many motifs in the Tang period, which was heavily influenced by trade along the Silk Road. This trend of mixing the dragon with new artistic ideas, especially with new religious imagery, continues heavily into later dynasties such as the Song dynasty. (c. 7th century AD)., Tang Dynasty. Jar with Dragon-Headed Handles, Stoneware. The Metropolitan Museum, New York. Another noteable dragon artwork that seems to be directly influenced by Chinese contact with the west along the Silk Road is this stoneware Jar with Dragon-Headed Handles (7th Century AD). It is currently housed in the Metropolitan Museum of New York. Without the dragon handles, at first glance the jar does not seem strikingly “Chinese” in style. In fact, many of the stylistic elements (from the color, to the shape, to the floral decorations) appear to be Greco-Roman in nature. This makes this item a unique piece, reflecting the influx of artistic ideas during the Tang period. It is most likely that, with the Silk Road encouraging exchange from China to the West, artistic designs would have easily spread during this period. Like the Gilded Dragon, the dragon handles has this flow-like design, a form that has come to define Chinese dragons in this period. "],
["Dragon-Paintings.html", "Dragon Paintings in the Song and Yuan Dynasties The emergence of Dragons as an Independent Genre Dragon Paintings as Bearers of Rain", " Dragon Paintings in the Song and Yuan Dynasties The emergence of Dragons as an Independent Genre During the Song dynasty, dragon paintings emerged as an independent painting genre. As a result, Chinese artists were given more room to experiment with styles, techniques, and compositions that they felt would best capture the likeness and spirit of the imaginary creature (Tseng). Simultaneously, ideas about the representation of the supernatural (including dragons) regained discussion as scholars pointed out that the form of the supernatural could be easily fabricated since they are not fully visible (Wenyuange). Nonetheless, the composition and form of the dragon developed during the Song Dynasty are closest to what is now generally regarded as the Chinese Dragon.

Chen R., (First Half of the 13th Century). Nine Dragons; Handscroll, ink on paper. Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Nine Dragons is a paper scroll by southern Song dynasty artist, Chen Rong, measuring 46.8 cm in height and 14996.5 cm in length. Chen Rong is widely celebrated for his depictions of dragons and this painting, in particular, is highly praised for its grandeur length and style. The monochromatic black ink painting dates back to 1244 and is currently the lengthiest surviving painted dragon scroll. It is now housed in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The painting also features running scripts and inscriptions that give details about Chen Rong’s motivations for the painting. From the inscriptions, we know that Chen Rong was inspired by two earlier paintings, namely, Nine Horses and Nine Deer. They were, respectively, created by Cao Ba (AD 704-770), a general and painter of the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907), and Huichong, a monk and painter active in the early Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127). Not to many’s surprises, Chen Rong also painted another famous dragon handscroll called Five Dragons, but in vertical orientation. Dragon Paintings as Bearers of Rain Another development of dragon art as it pertains to the Song and Yuan dynasties is the conception of dragons as water. As such, dragon paintings were used in rain rituals by the state to summon rain (Purtle). In Song Shi (The History of the Song Dynasty), three accounts of state-prescribed rain rituals were recorded, two of which used dragon effigies. Although the state had a well-defined and prescribed image of the dragon that was to be used in rain rituals as outlined in Painted Dragon Method of Praying for Rain (畫龍祈雨法), Chen Rong’s dragon is a strong deviation from that form. Regardless, the masterpiece was highly praised for being exceptionally good at summoning rain. The greatest difference in composition is his technique of action painting. This technique, which is said to be most effective when Chen Rong was drunk, involves blotting, spitting, splashing, and splattering ink on the surface of the paper to create an image of rain and supernatural energy. Thus, the splattered and smeared ink became clouds, and split from the mouth became mist. In the 6th line of his poetic inscriptions, Chen Rong writes “Drunk, I spit forth painting from within (醉余吐出胸中畫)” (Purtle). But all of this to Chen Rong is largely a part of his creative process rather than for ritual purposes as he underscored the ability of his painted dragons to bring rain in lines 32 and 34 of his inscriptions. Dragon rain rituals continued into the Yuan dynasty with most paintings being either a close copy of Song dragon paintings or previous paintings used repeatedly. One such work is Beneficent Rain by Zhang Yucai. Zhang Yucai was the thirty-eighth pope of the Zhengyi (“Orthodox Unity”) Daoist church, who lived at Mount Longhu (Dragon Tiger Mountain) in Jiangxi Province. He was often called upon by the Yuan court to commence rain and snow. Similarly, he would also perform rituals that summoned thunder and lightning to quell a sea monster. Zhang, Y. (C. Early 14th century) Beneficent Rain; Handscroll, ink on silk. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, United States. In Beneficent Rain, Zhang Yucai borrowed heavily from Chen Rong’s Nine Dragons scroll. Chen Rong’s style is so meticulously mimicked that the exact pictorial form and composition of Zhang’s dragons are mirror-image reversals of Chen Rong’s third and fourth dragons. Additionally, Beneficent Rain has a similar imagery of water and wetness that is used to represent the atmospheric effects of rain. Although there is no existing text connecting these two works, the fact that Zhang Yucai presumably copied parts of Nine Dragons’ inscriptions indicates that he intended to duplicate the ritual agency of the original. Unlike Chen Rong’s dragons, Zhang Yucai’s dragons are ink on silk and are housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. "],
["ming.html", "Dragons as Political Symbols", " Dragons as Political Symbols (1403-1424, Ming Dynasty Yongle Period). Sutra box with dragons amid clouds; Lacquer with gold inlay and brass. The Metropolitan Museum,New York. This is a Wooden Sutra Box dating to the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty (1403-1424) and likely made in an imperial workshop. It is decorated with red lacquer, gold inlay and brass lock/hinges which depict five clawed dragons amid clouds. Dimensions are H. 5 1/2 in. (14 cm); W. 5 in. (12.7 cm); L. 16 in. (40.6 cm). Located in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. This lacquerware sutra box was created for use in the Yongle emperor’s court. It can be seen that the dragons depicted on this piece have five claws indicating that this was created for the explicit purpose of being used by the emperor himself or by members of his court. While the specific association of the emperor to five-clawed dragons only came about in the Yuan dynasty, the more general association of the emperor to dragons can be traced to Liu Bang who founded the Han dynasty and claimed descent from a dragon. In addition to its political symbolism this dragon also maintains religious significance. Dragons have been used as an auspicious symbol in Chinese art for millenia. However, this particular usage of a dragon in Buddhist art can be seen as a continuation of the Song dynasty’s use of existing Chinese symbols in place of more traditional Indian symbols. (c. 1522-1566, Ming Dynasty Jiajing period). Dish with character for longevity (shou); Lacquer. The Metropolitan Museum, New York. This is a Lacquer Ware Dish with Dragons from the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty (1522-1566). It is decorated with auspicious symbols such as dragons and the character for longevity (壽, shou). Dimensions are H. 1 5/16 in. (3.3 cm); Diam. 6 /4 in. (17.1 cm) and it is also located in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art This lacquerware from the Jiajing emperor’s rule illustrates the dragon’s symbolic association with the concept of longevity which stands as a Daoist ideal. This can be seen in its placement alongside other auspicious symbols such as the stylized shou (壽) character which often appears in Daoist artworks due to its meaning of longevity and flaming pearls which often represent immortality and vitality. This piece also shows the continued symbolic association between dragons and imperial power, particularly the usage of five-clawed dragons to represent the emperor himself. The presence of these symbols indicates that this was crafted for the use of the emperor or his court. However, the exclusive nature of this symbol can also be seen in the fact that each dragon has the fifth claw filed down in order to allow its possession by a noble outside of the imperial court. "],
["conclusion.html", "Concluding Remarks", " Concluding Remarks The earliest image of the Chinese dragon is the Jade Pig-Dragon ring found in a ritualistic burial by the Hongshan culture. This piece gives the viewer a clue to the primitive idea of what was a dragon and the meaning the early Chinese cultures gave it. In later years the ritualistic context of the dragon continued through the Shang Dynasty, as a prominent symbol in the heavily decorated bronze ritualistic vessels. Yet its representation was overshadowed by the taotie, a monster figure that was highly feared and used during the Shang Dynasty. Soon later, in the Zhou Dynasty, the idea of fearing nature began to decline as dragon form decorations found on bronzes and precious jades became a symbol of wealth and luxury. The dragon’s auspicious symbolism began to develop in the Qin Dynasty, which then became formalized in the cosmology of the Han prince Liu An who defined two of the five guardian beasts (Yellow Dragon, Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird and Dark Warrior [Black Tortoise]) as dragons. Thus, the Han people saw the dragon as a protective symbol and guardian with great powers including immortality. Dragons maintained their auspicious status in the Tang Dynasty, but their appearance began to change drastically with the influx of foreign artistic concepts brought in by the Silk Road. The physical form of the dragon starts to become more serpentine, less animalistic, with longer tails and curling, “flying” forms. The Tang is also known for the importation of foreign religions like Buddhism from this period on, dragons will be supplanted into religious imagery, giving these religions their “Chinese” twist. Following these Tang developments, the unique form of the Chinese dragon was more concretely illustrated on dragon paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasty. This period saw a rise in new compositions and forms of not only the dragon, but also the envirnoment that the dragon was situated in. In the late imperial period of the Ming and the Qing dragons maintained symbolic usage in religious art, but were more prominently used for political symbolism. This was a continuation of the Yuan dynasty’s use of five-clawed dragons as an imperial symbol, which both the Ming and Qing formalized to be exclusively used by members of the imperial family or court. From its appearance as the cryptic Pig-Dragon in Neolithic times to its imperial associations in the Ming and Qing dynasties, the enduring symbol of the Chinese dragon is firmly tied to Chinese art, and even to Chinese identity, as a whole.
