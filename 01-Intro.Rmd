# Introduction {-#intro}

Unlike the Western dragon, which is often depicted as a monster for noble figures to slay, the Chinese dragon is depicted as having a sacred, precious relationship with the Chinese people. As a long-enduring auspicious symbol, the dragon’s appearance in artistic and political objects has established its position as a symbol for the Chinese nation. Perhaps nothing is as “Chinese,” artistically speaking, as the dragon.
This brief exhibition will take viewers through the creation and development of the Chinese dragon, from its origins as ritual carvings in the Neolithic period to its complex appearance in the Qing dynasty.
